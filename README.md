In today's world, people depend on online transactions for almost everything. Online transactions have their own merits like easy to use, feasibility, faster payments etc., but these kinds of transactions also have some demerits like fraud transactions, phishing, data loss, etc. With increase in online transactions, there is a constant threat for frauds and misleading transactions which can breach an individual's privacy. Hence, many commercial banks and insurance companies devoted millions of rupees to build a transaction detection system to prevent high risk transactions. We presented a machine learning - based transaction fraud detection model with some feature engineering. The algorithm can get experience; improve its stability and performance by processing as much as data possible. These algorithms can be used in the project that is online fraud transaction detection. In these, the dataset of certain transactions will be taken from online. Then with the help of machine learning algorithms, we can find the unique data pattern or uncommon data patterns which will be useful to detect any fraud transactions. For the best results, the XGBoost algorithm will be used which is a cluster of decision trees. This algorithm is recently dominating this ML world. This algorithm has features like more accuracy and speed when compared to other ML algorithms
